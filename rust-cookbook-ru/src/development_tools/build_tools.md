# Инструменты времени компиляции

This section covers "build-time" tooling, or code that is run prior to compiling a crate's source code.
Conventionally, build-time code lives in a **build.rs** file and is commonly referred to as a "build script".
Common use cases include rust code generation and compilation of bundled C/C++/asm code.
See crates.io's [documentation on the matter](http://doc.crates.io/build-script.html) for more information.
